## How use it?

[中文文档](https://blog.wangmao.me/hexo-theme-hola.html) | [Issues](https://github.com/isecret/Hola/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

First, we need to install [Hexo](https://hexo.io). But that's so easy, so i think you can do it.

The next . Use `terminal` input the next command.

```bash
cd /your_hexo_path/theme/
```

Now. We move to your blog. We need use Git clone the repertory. Use `terminal` input the next command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isecret/Hola
```

Wait a moment. Hola has been installed to your Hexo. it's so easy.

All right. Let's turn it on! You need to edit `your_hexo_path/_config.yml`. find `theme` the param. Change it.

```yaml
theme: Hola
```

## Individualization

On the footer, Count the number of words, but you need to install the expand.

Use `terminal` input the next command.

```bash
npm install hexo-wordcount
```

Nice! At now, You need to edit `your_hexo_path/config.yml`. find `footer_wordcount` the param and change it to `enabled`.

About the theme Individualization, You need to wait for yourself to find out.

: ) Happy Coding.
